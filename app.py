                I began my career as a Software Engineer & Web Developer in the middle of 2020 while working as a freelancer on the side. I've had a deep passion for programming from childhood and this is what led me to began studying Software Engineering.

                I've also had to foster my knowledge as a Software Engineer and Developer since July 2022 studying in the ALX Cohort 8 Programme which has been so amazing. So far, I have been learning low level programming languages, ranging from C to higher level languages like C++, Python, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS & Others. 
                
                We were tasked to build a project from scratch and this is what bring the idea of this Mystery Number Game project.

                I currently work as a part-time freelance developer exclusively on Upwork. You can check through my repositories to see projects which I've been able to work on and contribute to both as a student and also as a programmer.

                In case you have any Questions or feel like connecting with me?
