# Mystery Number Game
<ul>
<li>As the player is granted 10 chances at the easy level, the game will iterate from 1 to 10 to determine if the entered number matches the actual secret number. Since the player has only seven choices in level medium, the game will iterate from 1 to 7 to check if the number matches the secret number. 
It will iterate from 1 to 5 if the player selects hard level since there are only 5 choices.</li>
<li>It will display that the secret number is smaller than the chosen number if the entered number is smaller than the secret number.</li>
<li>Whenever the entered number exceeds the secret number, the game will display that the secret number is greater, which serves as a hint for the player.</li>
<li>The game will also display the number of choices left. </li>
<li>Once the number entered matches the secret number, the player will be notified that he has won. </li>
<li>The game ends if the player cannot guess the number and he or she has no more choices left. This terminates the game. </li>
</ul>
